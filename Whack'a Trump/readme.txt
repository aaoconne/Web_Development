Game I wrote using CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. 
Similar to whack'a mole with a little twist. 
The name of the game is "Whack'a Trump". 
In this version of the game, instead of whacking a mole, you whack trump instead. 
Scoreboard keeps a count of how many times you 'whack' or click Trump's picture when he appears from the hole like a normal mole would do. 
After user doesn't whack Trump for longer than 10 seconds, he stops appearing from the podium and user can see the score they receive.
