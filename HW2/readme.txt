This is a interactive baseball game I made called 'Batter Up!'
The game allows the user to pick whether they would like to be the 'Home' or 'Visiting' team. 
For both offense and defense, there are 4 different scenarios that can play out. 
User has control on whether or not they lose the game by the selections they make.
