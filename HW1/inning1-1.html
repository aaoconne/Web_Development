    <h1> Crunch Time </h1>
    <p> 
    <b> You chose to be the visiting team so you're up to bat. It's the final inning and your team is down one score. </b>
    </p> 
    <p>
        The next set of options will give you a choice as to what you want to do in the batters box:
    </p>

    <table border="0">
        <tr>
            <td> <b> Swing at the pitch thrown and potentially make contact with the ball </b> </td>    
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> <b> Choose not to swing at the ball </td> </b> 
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p> Each at bat concludes with at least two choices, unless its an ending: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> 
                <a href="inning2-1.html">Swing 1</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href='strikeout.html'>Swing 2</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
